# Data fixes

Data QA done by CWF for Watershed Connectivity Restoration Planning

- `modelled_stream_crossings_fixes.csv` - note modelled stream crossings that do not exist or are not barriers
- `pscis_fixes` - based on comments in the PSCIS data, note OBS crossings that are barriers and locations which are not accessible to fish
- `pscis_modelledcrossings_streams_xref.csv` - manual matching of PSCIS crossings to streams and/or modelled crossings
