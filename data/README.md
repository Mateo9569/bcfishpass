Get location of falls as `blue_line_key`/`downstream_route_measure` from `bcfishpass.falls`

## falls_other.csv

Add user/community submitted falls not present in other data sources to this table.
Location of falls is recorded as `blue_line_key`/`downstream_route_measure`.


## wsg_species_presence.csv

A list of all BC watershed groups and presence/absence of target species (Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, Steelhead, West Slope Cutthroat Trout).
Data created by CWF/Hillcrest Geographics, 2019/2020.

Watersheds were assigned presence/absence of given species based on review of:
- BC Fish Observations
- associated FISS records/database
- literature review

**CAVEAT**
This list is by no means a definitive list of watersheds that may support salmon.
The list was generated as an input for prioritizing watersheds for further salmon/steelhead fish passage assessments.
As such, watersheds in the Columbia (upstream of the Chief Joseph dam) and Mackenzie Basins were defined as out of scope.
