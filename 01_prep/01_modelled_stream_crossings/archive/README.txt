modelled_stream_crossings_archive.gdb/modelled_stream_crossings_archive

## Background

This is an extract of IDs and geometries from the latest modelled stream crossing data.
When re-creating the modelled stream crossing layer, bcfishpass uses this layer to
ensure modelled_crossing_id values remain consistent.

Use of this file for any other purpose is not recommended.

## Updates

This file will be updated with annual bcfishpass releases.
