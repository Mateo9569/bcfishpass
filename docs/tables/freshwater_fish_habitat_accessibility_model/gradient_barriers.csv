``gradient_barrier_id``,unique identifier
``gradient_class``,Gradient (percent) associated with the point
``linear_feature_id``,"From BC FWA,the unique identifier for a stream segment (flow network arc)"
``blue_line_key``,"From BC FWA, uniquely identifies a single flow line such that a main channel and a secondary channel with the same watershed code would have different blue line keys (the Fraser River and all side channels have different blue line keys)"
``watershed_key``,"From BC FWA, a key that identifies a stream system. There is a 1:1 match between a watershed key and watershed code. The watershed key will match the blue line key for the mainstem."
``downstream_route_measure``,"The distance, in meters, along the blue_line_key from the mouth of the stream/blue_line_key to the feature"
``wscode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA fwa_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``localcode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA local_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``watershed_group_code``,The watershed group code associated with the feature
``geom``,The point geometry associated with the feature
