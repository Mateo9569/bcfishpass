# Valley confinement

An adaptation of the USDA's [Valley Confinement Algorithm (VCA)](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/valley_confinement.shtml) using BC's Freshwater Atlas and DEM. Output is used as an input to the fish habitat model.

## Resources

- the [Lanscape Scale Valley Confinement Algorithm](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr321.pdf) publication
- USDA [script and toolbox ](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/valley_confinement/downloads/VCA_Toolbox.zip) (ESRI/ArcPy)
- blueGeo open source [VCA implementation](https://github.com/bluegeo/bluegeo) (grass/gdal/scipy/skimage)

The code in this repository is primarily taken directly from the blueGeo scripts and adapted/simplified for using with the BC FWA and BC DEM.
